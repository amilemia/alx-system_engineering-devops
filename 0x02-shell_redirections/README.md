	100-empty_casks		script that searches for empty files or directories in the current directory and subdirectories and prints their names to the terminal (The 'find' command uses '.' to search for files and directories in the current directory. The '-empty' option specifies to only match empty files and directories. The "-printf '%f\n'" only the names of the empty files and directories should be printed each on a separate line).
	101-gifs		this script will search for files with a .gif extension in the current directory and its subdirectories, extract their names and sort them alphabetically, case-insensitively.

	103-the_biggest_fan	when you run this script, it will count the frequency of each word in the input (assuming the input is a list of words), and output the top 10 most frequent words in descending order of frequency. The output will be a list of words, with one word per line.
